# Globox
# This report provides details of an A/B testing experiment conducted for GloBox, a rapidly expanding online store. The aim is to bring awareness to the new food and product category through the use of advert banner thereby increasing revenue. The report presents the context, planning and execution, analysis and recommendation based on the outcome of the test. The experiment was conducted over a 13-day period for 48948 mobile users with a randomized control test into effectively even sampling control and treatment groups. The metrics under consideration were conversion rates and spend per user. The initial analysis shows that the sample size is not adequately sufficient to draw a concrete conclusion based on the test outcome and there is a need to review the volume. Insights showed different user behaviour across different segmentations. The test results showed that the new banner had significant impact on conversion rates but no substantial effect on the spend per user. The observations warranted the recommendation that to enhance the statistical power of the analysis and identify smaller differences, it is advisable to consider additional research, potentially with an expanded sample size. Extending the duration of the test is also recommended, all based on the assumption of no financial or service costs to the company.
